      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ruben Sanchez Ramirez, a first-year master’s student, graduated with Program Honors from California State University Channel Islands in 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science and Resource Management, and an emphasis in Resource Management. During his undergraduate career, Ruben conducted research supported by the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife on native pollinator abundance and distribution across both native and non-native vegetation and wrote a thesis on methods for measuring pollinator abundance for student-based surveying systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has also worked with the Ojai Valley Land Conservancy, a non-profit land management organization, on designing and implementing trail surveying methods to better utilize limited funding and resources. Ruben is native to the coastal city of Ensenada in Baja California and has helped own and manage seafood restaurants. He has witnessed what coastal resources can do for the economics and identity of coastal cities. Specializing in Coastal Marine Resources Management at the Bren School, Ruben hopes to develop coastal resource management practices and work with small coastal communities to help promote economic growth while protecting marine ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
